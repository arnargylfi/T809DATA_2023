    The batch estimate of the mean will not be exactly (0, 1, -1)
due to random sampling but it should be close to it, and the closeness 
will depend on the size of the dataset.
The two parameters that can be used to make the estimate more accurate are:
    Sample Size (n): Increasing the number of data points in your dataset 
will lead to a more accurate estimate of the population mean. 
The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, 
the sample mean converges to the true population mean. So, collecting
 more data points would improve the accuracy of your estimate.

Standard Deviation (Ïƒ): Reducing the standard deviation of the data points
 (in this case, reducing the value of sqrt(3)) 
would also make the estimate more accurate. Smaller standard
deviation means the data points are less spread out around
the mean, making the estimate less variable.
