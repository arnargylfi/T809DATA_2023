The default parameters in Sklearn were chosen (n - estimators = 100; criterion = "gini";  max_dept: = None; min_samples_split = 2; min_samples_leaf: = 1; min_weight_fraction_leaf: = 0; max_features: "sqrt", etc..) 
  
This yielded 
Accuracy, Precision and recall: 
(0.7985074626865671, 0.7525773195876289, 0.7087378640776699)
I chose not to interfere with the default parameters because there 
was no need and it is simplest.
