* According to the results from section 1.7, what is the best value of $k$ according to the objective function?
According to minimizing the objective function, K = 10 is best, but we know that the correct amount of clusters is 3, and we can see from 
the graph that there is a decrease in performance when jumping from 3 to 5 in low iteration numbers, but no significant change in higher iterations

* If we have $n$ samples and we set $k=n$, what would happen?
Then each sample would have it's own cluster, which is obviously not the goal
there is no meaningful clustering. 
* Is it a good strategy to set $k=n$? Why/Why not?
No, because each data point would be issued its own cluster or group.
